        "Your task is to build a model on some tabular data and explain predictions and  observations using shap. The task consists of the following parts:\n",
        "- **A1** - find the suitable dataset (contains at least 3 features), import it and describe. Provide vizualizations. Shortly describe the problem you're solving (e.g. predicting price, customer churn, etc) **(2 points)** \\\n",
        " *Recommendation:* find a simple and clean dataset with at least 3 features, preferrably with the continuous target variable - then you can apply the same explanations as in the tutorial. If you do some data processing, shortly describe it.\n",
        "- **A2** - build a non-interpretable predictive model (regression/classification, depending on your data, you need to select only one). Assess the performance of the model using the suitable metrics of your choice. Write a short report (several sentences) on the model performance **(5 points)** \\\n",
        " *Recommendation:* use XGBoost or RandomForestClassifier depending on your data. In terms of performance, try to achieve $R^2 \\geq 0.5$ for regression and better than random guessing accuracy for classification. For performance assessment use at least $R^2$ + MSE or accuracy/recall + confusion matrix. It is better to build a solid model on simple data rather rather than try to build some fancy model on fancy data.\n",
        "- **A3** - interprete the model results using shap. Write full interpretation for each feature for one of the observations. Show the waterfall plot for this observation. Show the bar plot for the mean absolute shap values as well. Shortly explain the meaning of that plot. **(8 points)** \\\n",
        " Recommendation: Correct formulation of interpretation is extreamely important, please check the lecture and the tutorial.\n",

        "*General recommendation:* You can follow the tutorial with the dataset of your choice. Keep your explanations rather simple. The main aim is for you to show that you understand how to build and to explain the model. Your code and short reports should show your understanding."

More advanced way is to use the transformer from Assignment 3. The hardest one is to find some custom model and dataset from the web. Grading does not depend on how advance option you take as the aim for you is to show your understanding rather than to build some complex models."
